# TrieGames
A program that solves word puzzles with a trie data structure

## Overview
This program currently can solve word jumbles and boggle maps. It does this using a trie data structure that is implemented by the Trie
and Node classes. To use this program, you can build and run it in Visual Studio, or run the executable in the bin directory. When running,
you can type unjumble [jumbled-word] to unjumble a word, or boggle to start entering a boggle map. When entering a boggle map, you will be
asked for allowed lengths. Type all if you would like all solutions, or you can type in the lengths you would like separated by spaces (e. g. 3 4 5).

Below is an example execution:

unjumble cabeno<br/>
 beacon

boggle

Allowed lengths: 6

awejfo<br/>
fewsin<br/>
wiejkl<br/>
yjiskt<br/>
wiejfk<br/>
fjolns
